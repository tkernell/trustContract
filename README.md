# trustContract
transfers assets to trusted group for a period of time

This is a smart contract that holds ether or ethereum based tokens for a period of time, essentially transferring ownership. The user chooses several people whom he or she trusts who can vote to move funds out of the contract. The decision must be unanimous, and therefore it is very difficult to move funds out. After the time limit is up, the original user can simply withdraw the funds. During the contract period, however, the funds are the property of the trusted group of people.
